## üìñ Project Overview

The project involves:

- **Data Architecture**  
  Designing and implementing a modern data warehouse using the Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers) to ensure data quality, governance, and efficient query performance.

- **ETL Pipelines**  
  Building ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes to bring data from multiple source systems into the data warehouse, ensuring data accuracy and consistency.

- **Data Modeling**  
  Developing a robust data model with fact and dimension tables, optimized for analytical queries.

- **Analytics & Reporting**  
  Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards to extract actionable insights from the data warehouse.

## üöÄ Project Plan and Execution

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Engineering: Building the Data Warehouse

- **Data Sources**:  
  Two source systems (ERP and CRM), with data provided as CSV files.

- **ETL Process**:  
  - **Bronze Layer**: Load raw data as-is from CSV files.  
  - **Silver Layer**: Cleanse and standardize the data, resolving data quality issues.  
  - **Gold Layer**: Create a curated, analytics-ready dataset by integrating both source systems.

- **Data Quality**:  
  Perform data cleaning to handle missing values, duplicates, and formatting issues.

- **Integration**:  
  Merge data from both sources into a unified data model.

- **Scope**:  
  Focus on the most recent dataset only; historization or slowly changing dimensions are not included.

- **Documentation**:  
  Create detailed data model documentation for technical and business users.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Analytics & Reporting

- Develop SQL queries to analyze:  
  - Customer behavior  
  - Product performance  
  - Sales trends

- Use SQL Server‚Äôs built-in features to generate reports and visualizations for business users.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies

- **Database**: SQL Server  
- **ETL Processes**: SQL scripts (for data ingestion, cleansing, and transformation)  
- **Data Model**: Fact and dimension tables following the star schema  
- **Source Data**: CSV files from ERP and CRM systems
